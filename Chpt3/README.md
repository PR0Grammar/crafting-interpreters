# The Lox Language

## Intro
- Lox is a language we will be working with to get our hands dirty. 

- It's syntax is member of the C family.

## A High Level Language

### Dynamic typing

- Lox is dynamically typed. Variables can store values of any type, and a single variable can even store values of different types at different times. Some errors will only be reported at runtime, where a typical statically-typed language may be able to pick up these issues (eg. divide string by int)

- Statically typed languages are a ton of work to implement compared to dynamically typed

### Automatic memory mangement

- There are two main techniques to manage memory in high level languages: reference counting and garbage collection (GC)

- __Reference counters__ keep count of the number of references to a particular resource.
